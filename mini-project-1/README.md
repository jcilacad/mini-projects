# Java Basics Repository

This repository covers the basics of Java programming. It includes topics such as syntax, data types, control statements, arrays, and strings. Additionally, there's a hands-on mini-project for creating a basic calculator.

## Topics Covered

1. **Java Syntax and Environment Setup**
   - Learn how to set up your Java development environment.
   - Understand basic syntax rules in Java.

2. **Data Types, Variables, and Operators**
   - Explore different data types (int, double, char, etc.).
   - Learn how to declare variables and perform operations using operators.

3. **Control Statements (if, switch, loops)**
   - Understand conditional statements (if, else if, switch).
   - Implement loops (for, while, do-while).

4. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Work with arrays (declaration, initialization, accessing elements).
   - Manipulate strings (concatenation, substring, length).

## Mini-Project: Basic Calculator

### Description

Create a simple console-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

### Tasks

1. Set up your Java development environment.
2. Create a `Calculator` class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Implement a `main` method to interact with the user and perform calculations.
4. Use `java.util.Scanner` for user input handling.
5. Handle exceptions for invalid input and division by zero.
